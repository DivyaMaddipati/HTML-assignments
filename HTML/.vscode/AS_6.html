    <p>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.</p>
    <strong>Technologies involved : </strong>
    <ol type="square"> 
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Angular</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The world of full-stack development is large, and many new and evolving technologies continually push the limits of what a full-stack developer can create. Staying on top of cutting-edge technology and techniques in the full-stack development field is one of the many exciting aspects of working in this role.</p>
