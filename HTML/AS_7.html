    <strong>What is Programming ? </strong>
    <br>
    <p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.

    <p>And many more.....</p>
    <p>At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do. First, a programmer writes codeâ€”a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. Next, a compiler converts each line of code into a language a computer can understand. Then, the computer scans the code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. Tasks might include displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text. </p>
